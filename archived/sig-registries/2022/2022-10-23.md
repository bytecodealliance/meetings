* [Bailey] Docker has bundled in wasm-edge and can launch wasm modules. If they start down this route, they may invest in their own things and not component-model.
    * [Luke] There's a protocol concern (OCI vs. warg) and then there's the wasm-edge and runtime semantics. Are they trying to make wasm as grab-and-go as containers? Is this "just do wasm containres" approach?
    * [Radu] I think they're even aot compiling wasm and that's what gets run
    * [Taylor] do we have any strategy for handling obvious pushback around existing solutions?
    * [Taylor] we should lead with what it's doing on the component side and how we're not just treating it as bytes
    * [Bailey] one thing that helps is that we want to have canonical components that are widely useful and very appealing.
