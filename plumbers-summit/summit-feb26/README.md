# Bytecode Alliance Plumbers Summit - February 2026

We’re happy to announce the next installment in our series of ongoing Bytecode Alliance Plumbers Summits, each designed to bring Alliance members together to collectively contribute to the strategic planning for the upcoming year. Our next event will be held as an all-online remote gathering Wednesday and Thursday, February 25 and 26, 2026. As with past Summits this collaborative work session will focus on identifying key priorities, addressing challenges, and charting a comprehensive roadmap that reflects the diverse expertise and perspectives within our alliance. Topics will be presented in two three hour sessions from 8am–11am US Pacific Time on each day. Full remote participation will be possible for anyone, anywhere as all sessions will be recorded so they can be watched on the Bytecode Alliance [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bytecodealliance) any time after the event.

We’d love to have you take part, so please add the event to your calendar. Because the event is all online there’s no need to register in advance or get an individualized ticket. 

We’ll share updates here and also provide them via an event stream on the Bytecode Alliance [Zulip server](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/).
