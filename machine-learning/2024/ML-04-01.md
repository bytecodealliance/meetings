### Notes

Short meeting; no transcript today. Below is a high-level summary of the discussion:
- __tensor data structure__: Steve believes that the "tensor as resource" representation is
  sufficient, no need to retain the older tensor data structure
- __graph encoding versions__: Stuart was under the impression Ayako had been thinking about this;
  he volunteered to create a starter proposal to discuss
- __tensor residence__: Andrew shared the latest [version] of his and Matthew's merged proposal to
  describe where tensors are located. It includes a new `device` record which boils down to a string
  name as well as new `tensor` resource methods to (a) `locate()` which device a tensor is on and
  (b) move tensors around with `move-to(device)`. Stuart advised caution here: we don't want to bake
  in an API that frameworks cannot support. The plan is to submit an official PR with this change
  and discuss more there.
