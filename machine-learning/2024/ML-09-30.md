### Notes

The meeting involved walking through the slides and then discussion:
- Michael was hopeful about WasmEdge's progress implementing the component model (end of year?);
  this would allow WasmEdge to be a second implementation of wasi-nn (a requirement for phase 3).
- Stuart registered strong disagreement to removing the "load by encoded bytes" mechanism on the
  grounds that the host could then artificially limit which models a WebAssembly program could use.
- We also discussed the test suite at length: since there are many frameworks/models/etc., it is
  difficult to create a test suite that checks conformance. For the next meeting, Stuart volunteered
  to present his take on conformance rules that would allow the test suite to be flexible enough.
