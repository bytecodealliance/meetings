### Notes

See the meeting transcript for full details; what follows is a high-level summary:
- __spec change__ to use names instead of indexes to refer to tensors ([wasi-nn#61]). Discussion was
  non-controversial; will merge after a week open for comments.
- __spec change__ to use resources to represent graphs, tensors, and execution contexts
  ([wasi-nn#59]). Some discussion about how to implement these changes in Wasmtime: @geekbeast and
  @shschaefer talked about who implements what since this could be a part of the ONNX changes
  @devigned is working on (currently waiting on publication of ONNX Rust crates). Second State to
  relay to @hydai to take a look for WasmEdge.
- announced intent to "shelve" [wasi-nn#55], a discussion to add a new `bytes` type, until
  absolutely needed; no longer needed for @geekbeast's use case.
- requested a proposal from @shschaefer for handling model encoding (e.g., opsets) versioning;
  @shschaefer will open an issue; also, discussed some ideas for fixing errors ([wasi-nn#42]).
