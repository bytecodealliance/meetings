### Notes

No meeting transcript, see notes below:
- __meeting time change__: results of the [poll] show that Monday at 9am (yes, Monday, sorry!) is
  the least conflicted time. This will allow us to still attend W3C activities like the W3C threads
  subgroup that will start in 2024.
- __Mojo__: Justin brought up the possibility of overlap between Mojo, the language, and wasi-nn. He
  referenced a [talk] about Mojo; we discussed whether Mojo could be a frontend or backend for
  wasi-nn. More information would be helpful here.
- __future__: Stuart asked about next steps for 2024. Andrew discussed implementation efforts to
  improve wasi-nn's test infrastructure in Wasmtime. We then discussed [#63], a pull request to add
  `kserve` as a graph encoding; the outcome of the discussion is noted there.
