### Notes

See the meeting transcript for full details; what follows is a high-level summary:
- errors: Stuart discussed the need for better errors and some options for passing these forth;
  expect a GitHub issue with the details.
- model encoding versions: Stuart also discussed the need for figuring out the version (e.g., ONNX
  opset) a model encoding uses before the user loads a model, which might fail; expect a GitHub
  issue with more details
