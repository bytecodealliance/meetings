# SIG-Embedded Meetings

### Welcome

A meeting for the the Bytecode Alliance Special Interest Group (SIG) for Embedded and Industrial Applications [(SIG-Embedded)](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/tree/main/SIGs/SIG-embedded). This special interest group, like all Bytecode Alliance special interest groups is open to the public. You do not need to be a member of the Bytecode Alliance to come along and join our meetings. All of our meetings are conducted virtually via Zoom calls. 

### World Wide Time Zone Coverage

In order to ensure our meetings are as open as possible we run time in 3 time-zones so we can cover as much of the globe as possible. The meeting rotate every 6 weeks and cover Europe + Asia Pacific, Asia Pacific + Americas, and finally a meeting which is Americas + Europe. Come along to the meetings which work for your time zone.

### Adding Agenda Items - Raising a Topic for Discussion / Introductions 

You are more than welcome to raise a topic for discussion, in fact it is encouraged that you do. If you are new to the group please feel free to introduce yourself. We pre-publish empty / placeholder meeting notes for future meetings in our Github repository, if you'd like to add a point for discussion create modify the future meeting placeholder and add your items to the agenda, then submit that as a pull request.

### Meeting Notes and YouTube Recordings

As mentioned above, we keep our meeting notes on this Github repository, as you can see these are organized by year. They are created in advance to allow attendees to edit them before the meeting and schedule topics for discussion. Once the meeting is complete the meeting notes are updated with the notes from the call. In addition we also record and publish the calls on YouTube, and they are available on the [Bytecode Alliance's YouTube channel ](https://www.youtube.com/@bytecodealliance)- we've our own [SIG-Embedded play list, you can check out here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdpcq7g42YhbGtFaGVdWcC54xqRJDjewG).

### Discussions outside the Meetings
The meetings are an hour long and conversations often need to spill over.  We use the Bytecode Alliance's Zulip server for our in conversations. Zulip is an open source alternative to Slack, and we've a [dedicated channel for SIG-Embedded](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/438936-SIG-Embedded). If a meeting is cancelled / rescheduled we will post to Zulip.
