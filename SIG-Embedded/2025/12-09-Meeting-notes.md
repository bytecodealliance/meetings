### Meeting Synopsis

This was a quiet meeting, with no fixed agenda. However Ron Evans opened up discussion on what the community felt where the highlights of 2025 and where the big things to look forward to in 2026. This lead to a lively discussion from Chris, Stephen, Luke and Emily. Michiel Van Kenhove attended, but just listened in on the call.



The group talked about LTS and the long discussions around that, which is aiming ot provide a secure, supported and consistant LTS (Long Term Support) version of WebAssembly. Stephen covered the latest presentation at the in person W3C meeting where Chris and Stephen presented the idea of a universal plugin providing additional cheap support for system interfaces, and even for implementing the component model. Luke talked about [BuildTargets proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/pull/378) including the ability to wrap a core module up into a component.



Chris highlighted that this was the last meeting of 2025 and that there was a need to update the meeting notes, meeting github pages to reflect this. Rob questioned on logistic of the next meeting. Moving forward into 2026 Chris highlighted how important it would be to improve communication in the E-SIG. Including having ICS files that can be updated to show when meetings are cancelled and better use of the mailing list.
