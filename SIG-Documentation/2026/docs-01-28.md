* Victor: A lot has changed in the [wit design doc](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md),
  it might be good to do a diff of featuresets for https://github.com/bytecodealliance/component-docs/issues/171

1. [Add quickstart that uses prebuilt components](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/component-docs/issues/141)
