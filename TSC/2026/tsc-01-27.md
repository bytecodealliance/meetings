### Agenda
The TSC reviewed the agenda for the meeting and a final agenda was agreed upon.

### Topic #1
The TSC reviewed current governance topics as identified across issues and pull requests in the Alliance governance and project repositories, consideration of projects for Hosted or Core Project status, Special Interest Group activities, nominations for Recognized Contributor, communications received by the TSC,  ongoing standards efforts within the W3C Community Group, topics of broad scope in the Alliance's Zulip community, and a recap of the most recent Alliance board meeting. Proper follow-up actions will be taken by reviewers on the requests and issues discussed, including scheduling meetings needed to advance active topics. 

### Topic #2
Finding a workable date for the planned Plumbers Summit event has become challenging given limited availability of key participants and industry events happening in March. After discussion the last week of February and first week of April were added for possible consideration, with a preference for late February even though that implies a tight schedule for organizing the event. Participant availability for those weeks is being confirmed, and organizing efforts advanced under the presumption that the event might need to take place at the end of February.

### Topic #3
David highlighted that the special election process has officially begun among RCs to select an interim Elected Delegate, with the nominating period open through February 9.

### Adjournment
There being no other business to come before the meeting, it was adjourned at approximately 10:57am PT.
