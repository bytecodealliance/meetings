### Agenda
The TSC reviewed the agenda for the meeting and a final agenda was agreed upon.

### Topic #1
The TSC reviewed current governance topics as identified across issues and pull requests in the Alliance governance and project repositories, consideration of projects for Hosted or Core Project status, Special Interest Group activities, nominations for Recognized Contributor, communications received by the TSC, and ongoing standards efforts within the W3C Community Group. Proper follow-up actions will be taken by reviewers on the requests and issues discussed.

### Topic #2
Oscar's update at last week's Alliance board meeting on ongoing TSC investigation of outsourced compliance test development resulted in an action item for the TSC to solicit proposals for further review. David reported that he has begun that process and will work with Andrew to engage vendors interested in the opportunity.
