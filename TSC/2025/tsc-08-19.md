### Agenda
The TSC reviewed the agenda for the meeting and a final agenda was agreed upon.  

### Topic #1
The TSC reviewed current governance topics as identified across issues and pull requests in the Alliance governance and project repositories, consideration of projects for Hosted or Core Project status, Special Interest Group activities, nominations for Recognized Contributor, communications received by the TSC, and ongoing standards efforts within the W3C Community Group. Proper follow-up actions will be taken by reviewers on the requests and issues discussed, including scheduling meetings needed to advance active topics. Members agreed on an approach for publishing notes from topic-specific TSC meetings as an important complement to minutes from these weekly working meetings.

### Topic #2
Discussion continued from previous TSC meetings regarding improving security handling and disclosure processes for the WAMR project in collaboration with the project team, leveraging insights from their recent CVE resolution experience. A few follow up topics were identified, with actions assigned to bring those topics into the conversation with the team.
