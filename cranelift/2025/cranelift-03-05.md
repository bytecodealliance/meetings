### Notes

- Updates
  - alexcrichton: no updates
  - fitzgen: announcement: updated Wasmtime/Cranelift exceptions RFC
    - https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/36
  - Rahul:
    - PR for SSE encodings in new assembler merged last week; working on more
      instructions this week and also starting on VEX encodings
  - saulcabrera:
    - Winch implementation of SIMD in x86-64 is complete; getting closing on
      aarch64
    - alexcrichton: multivalue SIMD fix landed; Nick found another bug locally;
      suspect that many failures bucketed with the original multivalue OSS-Fuzz
      bug, might want to check again
  - abrown:
    - working on assembler
    - recent issue: in Bazel build that isolates crates, code generated by
      assembler meta crate not visible in `OUT_DIR` seen by cranelift-codegen;
      person who discovered sent a PR to fix, but not sure about it
      - maybe move the actual implementation of ISLE-specific codegen out of
        the assembler meta crate and into the cranelift-codegen meta crate
      - alexcrichton: also, current PR exposes that codegen meta crate depends
        on *assembler* as we as assembler *meta* crate; want to depend on only
        the latter to avoid compiling the former twice (build-time improvement)
  - cfallin: planning to start implementing exceptions in Cranelift + Wasmtime
    next week
  - erikrose:
    - disabled shuffling allocator in Sightglass
  - Amanieu:
    - working on performance of RA3; suspect can get to 10% slower compile than
      RA2 in exchange for 5% faster code
      - cfallin: would be great to have this an option, probably not switching
        wholesale
    - RA3 also uses a nightly feature currently (BTreeMap cursor)

- alexcrichton: exceptions: if we have a custom format should we write a
  dumper (vs. using DWARF)?
  - fitzgen: yes, definitely, we should have this
  - fitzgen: we should also be able to include it in disas tests
  - cfallin: equivalent of objdump -- we have enough custom stuff on top of ELF
    now that maybe this is the time; use Capstone for .text, etc
  - alexcrichton: `wasmtime objdump` with options to dump e.g. exception info,
    other bits; maybe or maybe not on actual disassembly, don't want to
    reproduce all of objdump
  - Amanieu: have written a thing that inserts text into the output of
    `llvm-objdump`
  - actually, maybe just use Capstone in-process
  - alexcrichton: will create tracking issue
