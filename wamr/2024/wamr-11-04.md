## Notes

- Siemens has a requirement. It involves updating a running Wasm module without completely stopping it. The update will be a tiny patch. A brief pause and resume are only acceptable if no running status is lost. Siemens is attempting to do this using the shared heap/memory and multi-memory features, but both present challenges.

- Another requirement from Siemens concerns AOT debugging. The current system allows the debugger to see parts of the runtime and/or embedding code. However, in Siemens' scenario, both sets of code should be hidden from Wasm developers, even in assembly mode.

- Siemens also updated the status of exception handling. There are several unanswered questions about handling exceptions that a Wasm module does not catch. Since Wamr is written in C, which lacks language-level exception handling, this issue is complex and fraught with potential problems. Therefore, a broad community discussion is needed. Siemens will open several issues to start the conversation.
