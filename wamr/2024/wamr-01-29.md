### - Intel team 2024 plan 
**Features:**  
- memory64， multi-memory, shared everything linking
- wasi-preview2 (likely the 2nd half year)

**Provide more developer support:**  
- AoT source debugger
- LLDB native support for wasm
- Wasmnizer-ts source debugger
- CPU utilization frame graph
- CPU time per function stats
- improve native wrapper solution
- GC observation

Already supported features and capabilities for developers:  
1. memory profiling: peak usage by stack, modules, app heap, opstack, native stack
2. memory watch point (trigger by access)
3. vscode extension

**Quality**
- [Yi Zhang](github.com/yzha107) will be focused on WAMR quality
- Collect input for quality improvement


### LLDB upstream support for Wasm progress 
- https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/77949
