## Notes

- Qi Huang reported on the shared heap feature development, noting a performance drop and ongoing work on solutions.
- Marcin Kolny discussed the dynamic linking feature, gathering community requirements, and planning for design and implementation.
- The team considered customer requirements for the WASI P2 module, including support for additional features like HTTP, socket, and crypto.
- Plans to upgrade toolkits, including LLVM, WABT, and wasi-sdk, were shared, with a focus on ensuring AOT compatibility and seeking any concerns from the team.
- The wishlist for new features was discussed, with memory64 already developed for the classic interpreter and AOT. The necessity of bringing memory64 to fast-interpreter mode wasn't urgent(in 6 months), and table64 and multi memory were given lower priority.
- Dominik Tacke brought up the need for improved AOT debugging, and Qi Huang acknowledged the issue, mentioning a patch to improve the debug experience on embedded devices but also highlighting existing limitations.

## Action Items

- Qi Huang to submit the PR for AOT debugging improvements.
- Dominik Tacke to raise a new ticket for AOT debugging issues.
- The team to continue discussions on GitHub regarding dynamic linking and WASI P2 module requirements.
- Toolkit upgrades to be executed in the coming weeks, with additional tests to ensure AOT compatibility.
