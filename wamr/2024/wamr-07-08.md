## Notes

- For now we'll take notes (one person nominated for that at the beginning of every meeting will do that) along with the auto-generated meeting notes by the AI; once we raise confidence, we'll only use the auto-generated notes
- We've agreed to stick to the current time for the meeting as it works well for both Europe and Asia, the meetings will be organized once a month
- @He, Liang(Intel) shared the general WAMR roadmap
  - in-progress items (shared heap, AOT source debugger, Python as a new guest platform, WASM as IR, WASI-NN improvements)
  - exception handling
  - multi-memory
  - speed-up AOT generation
  - shared-everything dynamic linking
  - wasm32-wasi module support
- @Kolny, Marcin (Amazon) will start a thread in Github to discuss the next steps for dynamic linking
- @Trenner, Thomas (Siemens) gave a brief update:
  - Siemens will dedicate more resources focusing on WASM ecosystem development
  - The company is interested in the AOT speed-up, AOT source debugger, dynamic linking (for micropatching) and shared heap work streams
  - Experiments with wasm2c allowed to reduce the total code size to a few hundreds bytes, which is not possible to achieve with WAMR right now
- @Huang, Wenyong briefly described the WASM as IR for native module project, which is similar to wasm2c but it is LLVM IR based solution, it allows to compile the wasm file into an object file, which can be linked with an auxiliary library into a native binary, e.g. executable or shared library. It removes the AOT runtime dependency and provides two modes: one is sandbox mode, in which the wasm sandbox is kept and the wasm address space and native address space are different. The other is no-sandbox mode, the wasm sandbox is discarded but it allows sharing pointers (both memory pointers and function pointers) between wasm and native, the address space is the same in wasm and native. It's already in the PoC stage but Intel is planning to open-source the work.
- We've briefly discussed the WASM IR project - it's driven by the Android team and is aiming to enable app developers to deploy native components as WASM modules so they can be later compiled for specific platforms

## Action Items

- [x] Liang will post notes
- [ ] Marcin will start a thread to discuss dynamic linking
