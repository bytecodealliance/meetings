## Notes

- Present the current manual tests conducted for a WAMR release. This encompasses tests for wamr-ide, lldb (with WAMR enhancements), and tests for embedded platforms using qmenu. If there are more efficient methods to automate these tests, that would be excellent.
- Debate whether wamr-ide and lldb (with WAMR enhancements) should be excluded from the standard WAMR binary release to ensure thorough testing and maintain a high quality standard.
- Continue to employ manual tests for wamr-ide and lldb (with WAMR enhancements) when releasing them separately.
- Amazon might possess some BKM for dockerizing a qmenu environment for testing embedded platforms.
- Rather than altering the current Alloc_Pool mode, it would be preferable to introduce a new mode.
- The shared-heap feature and its enhancements represent a distinct approach compared to the multi-memory proposal.
- The Siemens team is exploring various approaches to refine the GDB stub solution for AOT debugging to meet their product requirements. A recent update is that, since a complete stop is not permissible, using tracepoints may be more suitable than breakpoints.
- The development of another feature, exception handling, is ongoing. Its progress will be updated in the ticket shortly.

## Action Items

- Initiate a ticket to gather feedback on the release schedule.
- Provide feedback on the _New Allocation Strategy in Pool Mode_.
- Comment on the progress of the exception handling feature development.
- Initiate a ticket to gather feedback on next release.
