## Notes

* Andrew: given that Wasmtime may soon become a core project and gain a TSC
  representative, how should we, as a project, choose who that representative
  will be?
  * (agreement that the `@wasmtime-core` team members should choose someone by
    consensus, and if consensus-finding reaches an impasse, then via voting)
* Alex: demo of pulley profiler
  * (discussion of pulley performance, CLIF's RISC-y-ness, perf counters,
    etc...)
