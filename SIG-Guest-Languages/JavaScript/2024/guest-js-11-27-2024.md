## Notes

### JCO

* Guy: Jco release out last week
  * Guy: Top level resources fix has landed (also in ComponentizeJS)
  * Issue posted by Max from Zed, and that wasn't building w/ top level resources
* Types are being changed to possibly not generate namespaces
  * [https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/pull/528](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/pull/528)
  * Guy: We *should* be going for guest and host driven configuration for bindgen, in general those separate settings should take priority
    * Jco is designed for type import of a library, possibly by users who aren't writing components
    * There is some asymmetry between import/export bindgen, we need a document that specifies jco conversions
  * Victor: why use namespaces in the first place?
    * Guy: Named module is a name in the registry of types. If you're doing bindgen then the types will go into the registry which could cause conflicts
    * Guy: Description of host component consumption use case
      * Guy: In the future of BA registry, every component is dual published to NPM and has a TS generation for typesscript users already done
      * Guy: Any component imported should have typings for JS users
      * Guy: We want to avoid polluting the registry, as modules with declared names across all types used by the current user
      * Guy: The flags we want to set for the guest vs host will be different
  * Victor: Probably good to have a host binding generation example
    * Guy: On the host site there could be an option for turning off import type generation entirely
  * Guy: We should focus on usecase-driven changes where possible

### ComponentizeJS

* Guy: Top level resource fix here as well

### StarlingMonkey

* Tomasz: Got reviews for Blob implementation and after addressing feedback, ran into an issue with streaming where GC ran and moved and invalidated some pointers
  * Exposed by test, so good that we ran the tests for that
  * Started to work on the Blob API for request, response and file
  * Guy: we do need tests for GCs and trigger early GCs, along with running w/ aggressive GC
  * Tomasz: The problem is that we're keeping the `GSObject` slot in the HashMap (on the blob), fail to find the pointer in the HashMap and start from the beginning
    * Tracing can be added to the Blob, but some more impls would be necessary
* Tomasz: File API
  * File is basically a Blob, is it better to make the file a Blob and then handle it
  * Guy: Performance is more important than the perfect abstraction, so writing and separating out non-shared functionality would work (possibly a shared base class)
* Tomasz: State of Rust bindings?
  * Guy: If someone is interested in that PR, they should be able to clone that branch and try to use it – according to Till it was ready to go when it was made.
  * Guy: Tomasz if you'd like to update and try to get htis PR up to date please do.
* Guy: StarlingMonkey WinterCG support
  * [https://github.com/orgs/bytecodealliance/projects/14/views/2](https://github.com/orgs/bytecodealliance/projects/14/views/2)
* Async story in jco
  * Calvin: there are more tests needed, some design decisions around caching/reuse (re-entrancy is not supported)
    * No good solution for asyncify inside components at present (wasm-opt has not been componentized)
    * Guy: What if we make a WIT interface for wasm-opt ?
      * Calvin: This is what I was going to try – have tried to compile as a WASI p1
      * Guy: Even if that doesn’t exist, component could import this and the host could provide it?
      * Calvin: wasm-opt as a component would make this much easier to work on the Rust side – current code is breaking the component into core modules, apply then re-construct (on the JS side), but the parser logic seems to be a little fragile.
        * Guy: This issue previously was growing the binary instead of shrinking it (which is a somewhat new modification)
  * Guy: Figuring out testing story is probably going to be very important (nested components, sync/async, etc) full coverage will be likely pretty difficult
