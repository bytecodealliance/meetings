## Notes

### JCO

* Latest toolchain releases out
  * jco@1.7.1 and ComponentizeJS@0.13.1. Worth checking the release notes
  * https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/releases/tag/1.7.1, https://github.com/bytecodealliance/ComponentizeJS/releases/tag/0.13.1

### ComponentizeJS

* ComponentizeJS has some important bug fixes for supporting resources and the performance builtin worth noting
* Debug build of ComponentizeJS still not carrying naming information, traced it down to a possible wasm-opt or toolchain bug with the RelWithDebInfo build in StarlingMonkey. Shame since we are so close to supporting proper traces
  * https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/issues/173
* Great work by Victor on docs\!
  * 2 sets of docs
    * [https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org)
    * [https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/pull/514](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/pull/514)
* Great work by Calvin on async\!
  * [Draft PR into jco for JSPI & Asyncify](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/pull/518)
  * Allows for specifying which imports/exports should be async
  * Keeping this PR small, and will have another one for the WASI shims & web platform APIs
  * Need to sync with Guy and do a pair review, as impl has changed a bit since plumber summit
  * JSPI supports re-entrancy, but Asyncify **does not**. Looks like components will have to be re-instantiated in the Asyncify case
  * Some remaining work
* **Till:** Work on piping multiple bodies into an outgoing body (from guest)
  * Opened PR [https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/pull/171](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/pull/171)
  * This PR contains a test case that takes in a request and turns it into multiple requests (one for each word in a sentence), and those get streamed back letter-by-letter & reconstructed.
    * Interesting to run w/ `curl` and seeing the streaming responses, since they come in parallel, makes for a good demo
  * This works and allows you to do things like combine chunks of video streams into one outgoing stream
  * Started working on this due to working with Joel on the `append` operation for `wasi:http`’s `OutgoingBody`
  * Right now you have to keep the component around during the splicing but the hope is that you can terminate the instance while the splicing finishes
  * Good demo might be sending 1000 requests to a wasmtime host and showing the memory usage w/ or w/out append
  * Not covered by Web Platform tests – didn’t encounter any failures, had to build our own test
* **Victor:** Found a bug w/ unreachable fn in `jco`
  * Error:

```

```

* **Calvin:** Also this [https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/issues/517](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/issues/517)

### StarlingMonkey
  * **Tomasz:** [Blob builtin support PR](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/pull/169)
    * **Till**: Looked at it, in-depth review is not done yet but it looks great
    * **Tomasz:** Passing 200 platform tests out of 230 right now, still some details left
    * **Till:** It may not make sense to wait for all the WPT tests to pass – some could be dependent on other parts that are not implemented (unrelated to Blob)
      * **Tomasz**: I do want to update the test harness (git revision), is that fine?
        * **Till:** Please do\!
