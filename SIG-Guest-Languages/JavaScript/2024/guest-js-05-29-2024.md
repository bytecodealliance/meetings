Notes

* \[Guy\] Update on StarlingMonkey:  at Fastly we are working on standardizing on StarlingMonkey runtime. Been porting all the custom Fastly APIs. Potentially, replacing the existing runtime in a few months. Mostly done at this point. Going forward Fastly will be able to contribute more as it becomes a production dependency. PRs landing recently have been improving the tests and compatibility. One outstanding issue is the fetch implementation is broken. Till put up a draft [PR](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/pull/52) to fix the fetch implementation. The last missing piece is really the fetch support. Thereâ€™s an issue with building the release build that still needs to be figured out, see [PR](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/pull/53). Been getting some contributions from Fermyon on ComponentizeJS.
