Notes

* \[Guy\] We are having regular weekly meetings with Till on StarlingMonkey, which now officially a BA project:  [StarlingMonkey](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey). We are holding publicly announcing the project until we fix some remaining issues. For example, a fetch error: [Issue 19](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/issues/19). Need to implement CI and conformance testing finished setting up. Also, finishing the remaining 10% of user polish. Finished a PR for top-level `await`. StarlingMonkey acts as a bundler at start-up time, which helps in performance and error stacks. My focus is on getting Fastly setup on using the runtime.
