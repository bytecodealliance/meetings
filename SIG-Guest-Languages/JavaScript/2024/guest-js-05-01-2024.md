Notes

* \[Guy\] Update on StarlingMonkey development is going really well. Till has been very responsive with [PRs](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed). There is a path on implementing the [NodeJS resolution algo](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/esm.html\#resolution-and-loading-algorithm) inside of the StarlingMonkey resolution algo. Builds without a bundler that has some nice properties. Can define builtins easily. In the process of porting the Fastly integration tests into the StarlingMonkey implementation. Found a base64 bug fix from those tests. Working on fully handling the event loop, starting with a design discussion on the implementation. Also, have PR up for Fastly to StarlingMonkey and passing \~20% of Fastlyâ€™s integration tests. Involves copying over Fastly builtins over and wiring it up into StarlingMonkey. Hopeful that we will be able to standardize on StarlingMonkey.
