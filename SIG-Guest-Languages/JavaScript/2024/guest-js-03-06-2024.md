Agenda

* Wizer and Component-init  
* Testing / benchmarking infrastructure  
* 

Notes

* Fastly and Fermyon having ongoing discussions to move forward with the JS collaboration publicly;  
* Wizer and Component-init work almost the same way; Key diff Wizer works on core wasm module where you have direct access to linear memory but Joel’s workaround is exporting functions to access the memory; Both generate a new module or component that is instrumented for every piece of mutable state, and then you setup an initializer and run that on the instrumented version. Then it extracts all the mutable state and outputs a new version of the module or component with a snapshotted state. Component-init has a hook for the execution engine. Component-init is limited to a subset of components and doesn’t support all features not nested components.  
* Testing / benchmarking infrastructure with an environment for testing platform APIs? Specifically, benchmark Wasm spidermonkey runtime code running HTTP handler in Wasmtime to give feedback on performance of requests/sec and latency.
