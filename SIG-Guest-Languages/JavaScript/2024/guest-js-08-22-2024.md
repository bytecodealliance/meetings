## Notes

### JCO

- New release for updated wasmtime (https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/releases/tag/1.4.4)
- Guy: are we generating types for deprecated gate? We might need an extra flag for this to ensure that it can be excluded
- Guy: Other than that, mostly bugfixes, some deduplication code
- Ralph: Microsoft is working on a VSCode debugger for jco
  - Dirk has gotten a great start setup
  - Chatting with Till, informal agreement to get start/stop/attach working, we could work on mapping from Debug Adapter API to SpiderMonkey debugging API
  - Would be great to have it be as generically useful as possible, more feedback would be appreciated
  - Guy: There is a proposal in wasmtime for a DAP adapter
  - Dirk: As long as wasmtime provides symbols/something to attach to
    - But we definitely dont' want to debug the wasm code -- we want to debug the in language code, important especially for languages that don't natively compile down to WASM
  - Guy: With a linked component, it would be nice to be able to jump through code multiple languages
  - Ralph: If a component has a metadata link to GHCR you could pull the source and copy it locally as well
  - Guy: What wasmtime will end up exposing for it's own debugger will likely be a version of the DAP protocol anyway
    - If we implement in a WIT-forward way it will be easy to switch out implementations
  - Ralph: Another thing to consider later is what is the best way to work on this to get it out fast enough

### SpiderMonkey

- Lots of work on [Weval](https://github.com/cfallin/weval) Passing implementation tests on StarlingMonkey
  - PR: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/pull/106
  - PR with how to use: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/pull/91
- Guy: Memory leak found
  - There's a URL built in that is paired with a URL Rust struct, not getting deallocated on the Rust side
  - https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/pull/105
  - Short lived edge applications is the current use case, there are no GC tests just yet
- Guy: Refactoring more compatibility changes
  - Passing ~40 more web platform tests, hopefully can keep making progress adding those
  - Node compat remains a goal
- Guy: Till has also made a PR to support rust bindings for StarlingMonkey
  - https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/pull/103
  - Now it's possible to author builtins for StarlingMonkey in Rust
  - It would be nice to narrow down the C++ core, with most of the builtins and other code in Rust
  - One implication is the licensing of the Servo project which is MPL2
    - Discussed with the BCA, and it was approved earlier this year

### ComponentizeJS

- Guy: Release made to match recent JCO release
