Notes

* \[Guy\] ComponentizeJS released 0.8 with StarlingMonkey; Platform support went from `console.log` to a whole bunch of additional platform functions. Thereâ€™s a number feature flags that can even compile without WASI dependencies. Right now, going through testing features such as fetch. Working through `fetch` support today.
