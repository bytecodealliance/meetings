## Notes

### StarlingMonkey
  * `weval` integrated into StarlingMonkey (You can now use `componentize.sh --aot`)  
    * Patches inside SpiderMonkey that enable use of intrinsics got merged, along with build steps that execute `weval` for AOT.  
    * Passing all the web platform tests @ Fastly  
    * Blogpost for more information: [https://cfallin.org/blog/2024/08/28/weval](https://cfallin.org/blog/2024/08/28/weval)  
    * See also: [https://github.com/fastly/js-compute-runtime](https://github.com/fastly/js-compute-runtime)  
    * See also: [https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/weval/](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/weval/)  
  * New Project board for tracking compat  
    * [https://github.com/orgs/bytecodealliance/projects/14](https://github.com/orgs/bytecodealliance/projects/14)  
  * Note also the 1.0 board for coordination

### ComponentizeJS
  * Issue for `weval` support in ComponetizeJS   
    * [https://github.com/bytecodealliance/ComponentizeJS/issues/133](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/ComponentizeJS/issues/133)  
  * Async function support landed  
    * Implementation essentially sync-ifies the internal async functions  
    * Only exported functions (imports depend on host semantics until asyncify/workers on the `jco` side)  
    * Support for `fetch` does work (you can write a synchronous component that does `fetch`)  

### Jco

### Debugging
  * Work has started on the StarlingMonkey debugging effort already
