## Notes

### StarlingMonkey

* Tomasz: Few PRs waiting to be reviewed (some for new contributors w/ small fixes)
  * Event & EventTarget, AbortController & AbortSignal are pending
  * Documentation rework is pending as well (mdbook)
* Tomasz: Also starting to work through lints for C++ code
* Tomasz: Starting to have an issue with the size of StarlingMonkey
  * Right now, after componentizing, it’s around 10MB
  * When you precompile using cranelift it becomes 50MB, and when you start composing components it gets much larger.
    * Want to try and get rid of duplicated code in engine/individual components
    * wasm-opt’s option around DCE – being able to specify the root node and DCE everything else would also be a promising path (post wizer and weval)
    * [https://docs.wasmtime.dev/examples-pre-compiling-wasm.html](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/examples-pre-compiling-wasm.html)
    * Victor: Problem
      * [https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/examples/SharedEverythingDynamicLinking.md](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/examples/SharedEverythingDynamicLinking.md)
      * dlopen() approach and runtime support are both open questions
      * Zed approach is to package JS files and use a pre-existing StarlingMonkey component instance

### ComponentizeJS

* Tomasz: Embedding package.json into components that are produced
  * Victor: Use case?
  * Tomasz: We need this to power wkg when publishing to OCI
    * [https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component/pull/372](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component/pull/372)
  * Calvin: These are for the fields in custom section that wkg uses
  * Victor: sounds like a good idea, componentize-js would be able to do this w/ access to package.json
* Victor: Need a release of ComponentizeJS
* Victor: If ComponentizeJS wants completely automated releases, Jco has that now

### JCO

* Tomasz: work continuing on P3 shim
  * [https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/pull/653](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/pull/653)
  * Focusing on tests right now, HTTP
  * Victor: I’m for merging this when it’s tested and reviewed, since most people won’t actually be able to access it.
* Victor: refactoring jco codebase
  * [https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/pull/698](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/pull/698)
* Victor: Would like to make a jco-transpile project that is factored out, and only for the
* Victor: Would like to also add a wstd-like lib that makes common workflows easier to use
  * Tomasz: Would this be better in StarlingMonkey?
    * Victor: We do have something for nodeJS support, if that was merged then we ideally wouldn’t even need
      * [https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/issues/188](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/issues/188)
  * Calvin: What about Unenv for node support?
    * [https://github.com/unjs/unenv](https://github.com/unjs/unenv)
    * Victor: this is great
  * Tomasz: Still performance would suffer if we were to use this as all-JS
    * Calvin: Would be nice to get something working
    * Victor: Yep, then maybe ideally the extensions would be written in Rust to make contributions easier
  * Calvin: Where did we get on running/building components inside StarlingMonkey?
    * Victor: no idea where this is, Till would be the right person to ask
* Calvin: Still waiting on the browser p2-shim stuff right?
  * Victor: Yup\! Any time we can get some of that code (or even a portion of it) would be great once you’re done polishing/testing.
