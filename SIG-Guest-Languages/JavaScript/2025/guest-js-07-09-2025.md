## Notes

### Quick recap
The team discussed Node.js compatibility support and implementation details for Probot testing on Starling Monkey, including the creation of a separate preset package for unenv and considerations around polyfills and performance impacts. They explored various technical solutions for JavaScript environments, including file system and buffer functionality, while also addressing ongoing work on componentized JS and SpiderMonkey updates. The conversation ended with discussions about Zoolip Chat's fetch event handling, componentization progress, and TypeScript adoption for J.co, along with concerns about memory management and garbage collection.

### Next steps
Till to prioritize and complete the review of the event target PR.
Tomasz to create a separate PR for the garbage collector fix if Till cannot review the event target PR soon.
Victor to implement the fetch event feature flag in componentize.js.
Victor to integrate oxc parser into componentize.js for export checking.
Victor to continue work on async functionality in Jaco.
Victor to develop an adapter for Hono.js as part of the Jaco stdlib effort.
Team to review and discuss the PR for switching Jaco to TypeScript.
Summary
Probot Testing and Deployment Updates
Tomasz reported successful testing of Probot, a GitHub API application, running on Starling Monkey, using the unenv package for Node.js compatibility. He proposed creating a preset package for unenv to simplify Node.js application deployment on Starling Monkey. Calvin mentioned ongoing work with Vite's build system and Rollup, including exploring Roll down as a potential replacement. Till expressed concerns about the performance impact of using polyfills, particularly for operations like Buffer, which could lead to significant slowdowns in certain applications.

### Node.js Preset Repository Planning
The team discussed the placement and scope of Node.js compatibility support within their ecosystem. They agreed that a Node.js preset should be its own separate repository, potentially as a subproject of Starling Monkey, rather than being integrated directly into Starling Monkey or Component.js. Victor and Till aligned on the idea that while the preset should be built into Component.js for seamless integration with Node.js support in Starling Monkey, it should remain distinct from other projects like JCo and Component.js.

### Shim Layer vs Polyfills Discussion
Victor and Till discussed the differences between the shim layer and polyfills, with Till clarifying that the preset defines which built-ins are available and needs to be polyfilled, rather than being engine-agnostic. Tomasz explained that while UNENV can be used as a base, additional configuration and shims are needed for specific runtimes, making it runtime-specific. Victor raised questions about the changes needed for UNENV, and Till and Tomasz clarified that these changes are specific to the runtime and not just about polyfilling missing built-ins.

### JavaScript Buffer Implementation Strategy
The team discussed the implementation of file system and buffer functionality in their JavaScript environment. They clarified that Unend implements polyfills for JavaScript environments, which can be used without modification, while Starling Monkey has a pre-set for possible functionality. Till explained that using Wazi bindings would be faster than buffer implementations, and suggested a gradual migration path from polyfills to native implementations. The team agreed that a native implementation of buffers would be ideal, and that this could be achieved by gradually transitioning from polyfills to a more performance-oriented solution.

### Componentized JS and SpiderMonkey Updates
The team discussed ongoing work on componentized JS and SpiderMonkey. Till mentioned he needs to review Tomasz's PR, which is blocking some fixes. They agreed to split out a small fix into a separate PR to unblock Tomasz. Till also shared that Chris Fallon has been working on upgrading SpiderMonkey to a newer LLVM version, but this is proving challenging due to compatibility issues. The team decided to proceed with updating SpiderMonkey without WebAssembly support for now, as there is no clear timeline for resolving the compatibility issues.

### Resolving Fetch Event Handling
Victor and Till discussed the issue of fetch event versus incoming handler in Zoolip Chat. They explored two main options to resolve the problem: always exporting the incoming handler or using a parser like oxc to check for manual implementations. Till suggested using a feature flag for fetch event support, which would allow for optional HTTP server functionality. They agreed that a combination of both approaches would be necessary, using oxc to parse exports and check for manual implementations, while also having a flag to disable fetch event if desired.

### Component Progress and TypeScript Update
Victor reported progress on componentize, including work on async functionality and an upcoming adapter for the Hono.js project to address issues with fetch event usage. Till warned about potential garbage collection issues with long-running workloads using Wasi bindings. Victor mentioned that components built with Starlink handled a large number of requests in testing, and Calvin noted they were tracking memory growth. Victor also highlighted a new PR from Elmer to switch J.co to TypeScript, inviting feedback from the team.
