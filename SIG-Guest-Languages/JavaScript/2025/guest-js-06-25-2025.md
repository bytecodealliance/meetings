## Next Steps

- **Till:** Discuss with Joel about generalizing componentized-py or forking it for the proposed bindings generation approach.
- **Till:** Draft an initial set of operations and overall architecture description for the proposed bindings generation system.
- **Tomasz:** Prepare a PR for adding debugging session initialization to `componentize-js`.
- **Victor:** Implement the release automation for `componentize-js` before the next release.
- **Victor:** Release a new version of `componentize-js` by the end of the week.
- **Victor:** Continue working on the lower-level bindgen implementation for async P3, focusing on streams and futures.
- **Victor:** Perform three `jco` releases over the next 1-2 weeks: current version, version with updated `componentize-js`, and version using the new `jco` transpile.
- **Calvin:** Review Tomasz's P3 work and provide an update on the async P2 WASI shim browser-related changes.

## Notes

### General
- Till is back and will begin reviewing PRs.
- Victor reported that issues with project splitting and npm package changes are now resolved.
- Tomasz's Async P3 work has landed. Calvin noted a PR for P2 Async shims is still missing.

### StarlingMonkey

- **Unified Bindings Approach:** Till proposed replacing the current bindings mechanisms for StarlingMonkey and `componentize-js` with a unified approach. This involves a generic C header file defining operations for runtimes to implement, allowing for a unified, efficient toolchain across different languages and components. The system would handle initialization via code generation and use runtime instructions for marshalling. This would be a generalization of the `componentize-py` approach, adding support for type handling and shared implementation.
- **Compiling and Exporting:** Till explained the toolchain would compile the runtime into a `.wasm` file and export operations, which can be used as a shared library. It can synthesize core wasm files using exported symbols.
- **Fetch Event Fix:** Tomasz implemented a quick fix for a fetch event handling issue that resets state. However, Till and Victor cautioned that reusing instances for multiple HTTP requests could leak state. The team agreed to merge the quick fix but acknowledged a more robust, long-term solution is necessary.

### ComponentizeJS

- **Debugging Automation:** Tomasz and Till discussed implementing debugging for componentized JS. Till suggested automating the process by using an existing debug flag to initialize the debugger session during runtime export. Tomasz will prepare a PR to implement this, which will enable debugging for non-HTTP dependencies.
- **Release and P3 Support Planning:** Victor stated that `componentize-js` is ready for a new release once two PRs are merged. He will add release automation before cutting a new version by the end of the week. Till expressed a desire to generalize the `componentize-py` work for P3 support and will coordinate with Joel. He plans to draft an RFC to gather feedback on the proposed architecture.

### JCO

- **Releases and Porting:** Victor plans to perform three `jco` releases over the next 1-2 weeks. These will include the current version, a version with the updated `componentize-js`, and a version that uses the new `jco` transpile. He also discussed plans to port `jco` to use `componentize-js`.
- **Async P3 Progress:** Tomasz has landed his preview 3 shim work. Victor is continuing the work on the lower-level bindgen implementation for async P3.
