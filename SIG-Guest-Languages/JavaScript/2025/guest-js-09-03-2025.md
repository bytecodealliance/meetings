Various bug fixes and updates were discussed for JCO, including fixes to memory management issues and improvements to BindGen, while ongoing async work continues in multiple areas. The team also addressed memory management concerns in Spider Monkey and discussed the potential impact of Teal's progress on their WebIDL to WIT conversion work.

## Next steps
Tomasz to continue bisecting LLVM to find the commit breaking Wasm support.
Tomasz to investigate the continuous memory growth issue in Starling Monkey reported by Ludwig.
Till to resolve comments on the Starling Monkey update PR for Componentize.js.
Victor to release a new version of Componentize.js after the Starling Monkey update is merged.
Victor to continue working on async functionality implementation for Jco, focusing on stream and future implementations.
Team to follow up with Till about the Rust built-ins and WebIDL bindings for Starling Monkey in the JavaScript Subgroup thread.

## Summary

### Spider Monkey and Componentize.js Updates
The team discussed updates on various projects, including Spider Monkey and Componentize.js. Tomasz reported working on Weevil support and LLVM bisecting, which is challenging due to long compile times. Victor mentioned a new version of Spider Monkey was released, highlighting improvements like Clang Tidy fixes, board controller interface, and AbortSignal support. The team noted that an update to pick up the new Spider Monkey version is out for review, pending Till's input on resolving comments.

### Componentize.js and Jco Updates
Victor discussed updates to Componentize.js and Jco, focusing on a configuration issue in Wiser that was resolved by updating the Wiser and Componentize.js versions. He mentioned that Jco also received updates, including new versions of Component BindGen, Preview 2 Shim, and Jco Transpile. The changes were made to address compatibility issues and improve functionality across the tools.

### JCO Bug Fixes and Updates
Victor reported several bug fixes in JCO, including a legitimate bug in the nanoseconds to datetime function found by Lawrence Rowe, issues with the Shim object instantiation, and a missing throw error in the stream buffer limit bug. He also discussed updates to BindGen 1.12.0, which included adding simple dispose for JavaScript resource management and addressing TypeScript type issues. Victor mentioned ongoing async work in JCO, including stream and future implementations, and Tomasz inquired about a memory growth issue, which Victor clarified was fixed in JCO but may be related to Starlink Monkey.

### Spider Monkey Memory Bug Investigation
Victor and Tomasz discussed a bug related to memory management in Spider Monkey, noting that the issue might be due to insufficient garbage collection time. They agreed to investigate further by enabling statistics from the garbage collector and examining memory usage. Tomasz mentioned that Teal was making progress on Spider Monkey, which was seen as positive news. They also discussed the potential implications of this progress on their WebIDL to WIT conversion work, though Victor expressed uncertainty about whether they could eliminate their current tooling.
