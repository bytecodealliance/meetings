## Summary

### Spider Monkey Progress Update
Tomasz reported on recent progress with Spider Monkey, including landing PRs for events target, board signal and controller, and crypto-related work. He mentioned adding missing keys, cleaning up crypto implementation, and removing deprecated OpenSSL calls. Tomasz also noted that documentation had been merged and was now hosted on GitHub Pages, with plans to add an architectural overview section. He concluded by mentioning a discussion with Kat from Fastly, though the details were not specified.

### Node.js Rust Compatibility Planning
Tomasz and Victor discussed plans to work on Node.js compatibility starting mid-August, with a focus on implementing it in Rust. They agreed to merge a PR adding Rust bindings before starting the Node.js implementation. Victor suggested adding a link to the Starling Monkey documentation on the GitHub project page. They also discussed the release process, with Tomasz asking about reusing artifacts from releases in Starling Monkey. Victor expressed interest in this idea, noting it would be beneficial to avoid rebuilding components.

### ComponentizeJS Release Status Update
Victor discussed the status of recent releases for ComponentizeJS, mentioning that version 0.18.4 is ready but awaiting final approval. He highlighted several bug fixes and improvements, including issues with HTTP handlers, stubbing, and logging mechanisms. Victor also mentioned updating the version of Starling Monkey and confirmed that the new release would be out by the end of the day, pending final review.

### Async and Jaco Progress Updates
Victor reported progress on the Async work and implementation of Whipbin Gen Core, noting that while basic components like transpile and run are functional, the challenging aspects lie in handling edge cases. He mentioned that a PR for stabilizing task implementation is pending completion of Whipbin Gen Core work. Victor also shared updates on Jaco, highlighting that it is now updated to match Componentized JS, with several fixes and feature flag updates. Additionally, Elmer is working on converting parts of Jaco to TypeScript, starting with the Jaco transpile subproject, which is not yet integrated into the main Jaco package but will be used similarly to Componentized JS. Victor concluded that Jaco will likely see another release after the Componentized JS release, bringing an updated Starling Monkey.
