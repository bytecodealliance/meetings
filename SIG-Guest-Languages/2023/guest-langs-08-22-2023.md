## Updates

* Joe: Go subgroup meeting next Tuesday. We're sending an invite to everyone who expressed interest.
* Joel: We're trying to get guest tooling contributors to get to a level of consistency/stability of the WASI CLI wits ahead of WasmCon and Componentize the World. If you're a developer of tools, you might want to join in on that. The goal is to have a period of no-changes between this Friday and September 5th 
* Guy: Host-level support for resources in JCO with guest side coming soon hopefully.
* Joel: We're working on bringing Componentize-Py into the Bytecode Alliance with a proposal coming soon. Resource support hasn't started but we're working on fixing bugs and filling in gaps.
