# Recording Guidelines

Recording meetings is encouraged but not required.

## Code of Conduct

All Bytecode Alliance meetings, recordings, and communications must adhere to the [Bytecode Alliance Code of Conduct][coc].

If a violation has been addressed by a host and it has been recorded, the video should be edited before being posted publicly on the YouTube channel. If an attendee requests an edit, for example if private information was shared accidentally, the chair should edit the video.

## Naming

All posted videos should use the naming convention: "<SIG or project> - <meeting name> YYYY-MM-DD"

Example: "SIG Guest Languages - Go SG 2023-08-29"
